		{
			"q": "Hello,I have all of my solutions in one folder and have saved everything onto a location on my computer (not within VS), and everything is running smoothly. However, when I submit to Blackboard and redownload the submission to test it, VS is giving me the following error:  "One or more projects in the solution were not loaded correctly" and nothing appears on the screen.How do I fix this??Thanks, Brandon ",
			"a": "You need to check which project is not open correctly, and then, double check if you have that project in your submission folder."
		},
],

}
```

## To Do:

- Account for time and only parse until reaching last pull data
